            <h3>Starting the game</h3>
            <p>Terraria is a resource collection based game where you explore a randomly generated world while collecting materials to make your character more powerful in order to challenge the various bosses that are in the game to make progress. At the beginning of the game, the player is very weak and most enemies pose a threat, but by the end they are extremely powerful. The first boss the player must defeat is the Eye of Cthulu.

            <h3>Making progress</h3>
            <p>After the player has defeated the Eye of Cthulu, they will start to become more and more powerful very quickly allowing them to defeat the next few bosses such as the Eater of Wordls and Skeletron. After that, they must dig a tunnel straight down through much of the map until they reach the Underworld in which they must defeat the Wall of Flesh, the final boss of Normal mode.</p>

            <h3>End of the game</h3>
            <p>After defeating the Wall of Flesh, a message will pop up on screen saying "The spirits of light and dark have been released!", after which the world will change in some significant ways and more bosses become available to fight. This marks the half-way point of the game. After collecting newly available resources to further upgrade their character, the player will eventually defeat more and more bosses, until the final boss, the Moon Lord has been defeated.
